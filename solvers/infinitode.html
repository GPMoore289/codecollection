    <h1>Infinitode Bounty Solver</h1>
	<div class = "synopsis">
	<p><strong>Original Creation:</strong> 26th September 2021</p>
	<p><strong>Uploaded:</strong> 4th March 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Status:</strong> Complete. Original code was written without AI.</p>
	<p><strong>Description:</strong> So, this one is difficult to explain. There is a tower defense mobile game named Infinitode that I played for a while.
	There is an interesting mechanic regarding one of the towers: the Bounty tower. At the end of each round, the Bounty gives the player +2% of their current money pool 
	(on amounts up to $3000). You can buy up to 5 of them. Surely you want to get as many as possible as early as possible to capitalize on compound interest, right? 
	But if you buy them as soon as you can afford them... then you won't have any money from which to gain interest. Plus each Bounty costs more than the previous one.
	This was a mathematical quandary that I decided to solve using brute force calculation and random seeding. There's no intelligence in this approach, the program just runs
	repeatedly, calculates the effects of buying the Bounties at random levels at which it can afford to do so, and see which gives the fastest return on investment.</p>
	<p>I simulated expected income on each level, the rising cost of the Bounties, and their return on your pool of money. Then by editing the code, 
	I tried several strategies (shown below), the ultimate aim being to get all 5 towers and $3000 money in the pool at the <em>lowest level possible</em>. 
	As you can see, the best result of the ones I tested occurred when I bought the first two Bounties quickly, then waited until I had larger pools of money
	before buying the 3rd, 4th and 5th towers.</p>
