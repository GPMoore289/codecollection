	<p><strong>Original Creation:</strong> 7th April 2020</p>
	<p><strong>Uploaded:</strong> 25th Feb 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Status:</strong> Complete. Original code was written without AI.</p>
	<p><strong>Description:</strong> Early project. This was some of my earliest attempts at error handling and importing data from a csv, which I had to curate quite substantially. Garbage in, garbage out!</p>
