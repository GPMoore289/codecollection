	<p><strong>Original Creation:</strong> 29th April 2020</p>
	<p><strong>Uploaded:</strong> 25th Feb 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Status:</strong> Complete. Original code was written without AI.</p>
	<p><strong>Description:</strong> Every coder has to make this at least once, right? This was early in my coding learning, and my choice of names for variables is... not easy to read. 
	And for some reason, I thought putting the <strong>import</strong> function in the middle of the while loop was a good idea... that's actually kind of adorable in hindsight.
	Still, I think this was the first time I used the <strong>def</strong> function to shorten the code and follow the "don't repeat yourself" mantra.</p>
