    <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
	<div class = "synopsis">
	<p><strong>Original Creation:</strong> 4th October 2024</p>
	<p><strong>Uploaded:</strong> 3rd March 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Status:</strong> Complete. Original code was written without AI.</p>
	<p><strong>Description:</strong> Not to be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_of_Life">the board game with a similar name</a>, 
	Conway's Game of Life is a zero player game that starts with a few simple rules about whether a cell will live or die depending on its neighbours, 
	and each cycle produces an evolving display of elaborate shapes that spread, collapse, move, collide and eventually create static structures. 
	This version randomizes the initial layout, and will abort if the game reaches an all still lifes state, or if there is a 2 period oscillator. 
	It will continue running if it reaches a 3-or-higher period oscillator.
	This was the first extracurricular programming project given to me by my Intro to Programming professor, when it was clear I already had some 
	programming experience, and was my first project that successfully utilized a grid (unless you count <a href="noughtsandcrosses.html">noughts and crosses</a>).
	You may have to adjust the colours and window size on your Python shell to get the best effect.</p>
