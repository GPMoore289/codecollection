    <h1>Battleship</h1>
	<div class = "synopsis">
	<p><strong>Original Creation:</strong> 5th January 2023</p>
	<p><strong>Uploaded:</strong> 3rd March 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Status:</strong> Incomplete & non-functional. Original code was written without AI.</p>
	<p><strong>Description:</strong> Sometimes failed projects can provide valuable learning lessons. 
	This was my first attempt at making a grid-based game other than <a href="noughtsandcrosses.html">Noughts and Crosses</a>
	and as I had recently studied the <strong>numpy</strong> module on arrays, I thought they would be the best approach to this problem.
	In hindsight, I should have just used lists. I also started new work shortly after starting this and put it on hold.
	Maybe I'll remake it in the future, but I'd probably start from scratch, as this version is non-functional.</p>
