    <h1>Hearts</h1>
	<div class = "synopsis">
	<p><strong>Original Creation:</strong> 30th August 2024</p>
	<p><strong>Uploaded:</strong> 4th March 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Status:</strong> Complete. Original code was written without AI.</p>
	<p><strong>Description:</strong> During summer of 2024, I wanted to prepare for my upcoming programming class and get back into coding with a reasonably beefy project.
	Hearts is a game that anyone who has used a Windows computer over the last 25 years should be familiar with. The trickiest part was interchanging the names of the 
	face cards (Jack, Queen, King) with their values (11, 12, 13). In hindsight, this could have been accomplished with a dictionary. Still, it is playable, though the
    computer only picks legal cards at random. See if you can shoot the moon!</p>
