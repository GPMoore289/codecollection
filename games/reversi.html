	<p><strong>Description:</strong> The second bonus project presented to me by my Intro to Programming professor: 2-player Reversi
	I'd actually never played Reversi/Othello before, but just because I'm not good at the game, doesn't meet I can't code it.
	This took the lessons on making a grid-based game I'd learned from <a href="gameoflife.html">Conway's Game of Life</a> and made
	something that I'm actually quite proud of. You've really got to make sure that the game recognises the edge of the grid and
	doesn't wrap around to the other side. After all, I was having to present it to someone other than myself for once...</p>
