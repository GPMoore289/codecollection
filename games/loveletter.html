	<p><strong>Original Creation:</strong> 14th April 2020</p>
	<p><strong>Uploaded:</strong> 25th Feb 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Status:</strong> Incomplete. Original code was written without AI.</p>
	<p><strong>Description:</strong> A 2-player (player vs. computer) version of the popular card game. This was the most complicated project I had attempted at the time 
	and while I'm pleased to have finally started using the <strong>def</strong> function (though not in every situation I could have) and carefully covered every if/else indentation and logic implementation... 
	I realized that actually getting the computer to gain information from using the Priest card would require a bit more artificial intelligence
	than I was prepared for at this stage. It's not efficiently coded, but this was an early project for me.</p>
