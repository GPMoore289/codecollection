		<h3>This is a collection of my various coding projects since 2020. I generally write all code without use of AI, but have recently started to incorporate it into my work.</h3>

		<h2 id="basic">Basic Programming Projects</h2>
		<h3>These were created from September to December of 2024, as part of the Programming Fundamentals course at Mohawk College. 
		I already had a good grip of Python by this point, so solving these problems were often trivial in most cases. However, the course did introduce me to the use of AI in programming, 
		and placed an emphasis on correct code-writing discipline, as well as identifying errors in code.</h3>
