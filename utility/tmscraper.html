    <h1>Terraforming Mars (Board Game Arena) Web Scraper</h1>
	<div class = "synopsis">
	<p><strong>Original Creation:</strong> 17th May 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Uploaded:</strong> 19th May 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Status:</strong> Complete. Code written mostly by me with some AI assistance.</p>
	<p><strong>Description:</strong> I play board games in real life and online, and one, Terraforming Mars, has quite taken my fancy. 
	Yet despite playing literally hundreds of games of it on <a href="www.boardgamearena.com">Board Game Arena</a>, I am not as good at it as I should be. Perhaps I could figure out my strengths and weaknesses by analyzing my previous games?
	But I would have to scrape the data from BGA first. In previous projects, I had successfully scraped public data before and unsuccessfully scraped data that was in my user area, locked behind the log in screen. 
	Here, I finally got the web driver to log in successfully and access data that would have taken many hours to input manually. I did hit my game replay limit several times, but I just had to wait for it to reset.
	All data obtained was already accessible to me, and is not being used for commercial purposes. The program was intentionally slowed down so as to not overwhelm BGA's servers. 
	My personal details have been removed from the code.
