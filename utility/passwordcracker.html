    <h1>Password Cracker</h1>
	<div class = "synopsis">
	<p><strong>Original Creation:</strong> 22nd March 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Uploaded:</strong> 22nd March 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Status:</strong> Complete. Original code was written without AI.</p>
	<p><strong>Description:</strong> Passwords. They're a pain, but they're important. Nowadays, minimum of 8 characters, mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters seems to be standard.
	I remember during the early days of the internet when these restrictions didn't exist, and neither did login attempts. But this program demonstrates why the length of the password and
	having a large pool of characters to choose from is important. It creates a password at random using a bank of specified characters, then attempts to crack the password through brute 
	force. This program also demonstrates why brute force becomes increasingly ineffective (i.e. slow) as the password becomes more complicated. 
	I recommend starting with short passwords and small character pools, and working your way up from there. 
	The hardest part of the code was accommodating for the fact that the cracker might not "know" how long the password is, so using a set number of nested <strong>"for"</strong> loops
	wouldn't work. I eventually came upon a solution using a dictionary that keeps track of each digit and its current character.
