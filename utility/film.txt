With cinemas more or less fully reopened, but with many new films now going direct to streaming, I've decided to do a run-down of this year's new releases that I've watched, ranked from least favourite to most favourite.

*#*. Crimes of the Future. David Cronenberg's first body horror film in over 20 years and it's pretty lethargically plotted, not even reaching the level of eXistenZ or Rabid. Let's hope his son carries on his legacy better than he does.

*#*. Nope. Despite his newfound popularity in horror movie circles, I haven't been won over by Jordan Peele's films. While this doesn't have the crater-sized plot holes that Get Out and Us did, it still tries to blend elements that just don't work for me. Some good cinematography though.

*#*. Thor: Love and Thunder. Thor: Ragnarok is easily one of the best MCU films, but despite being helmed by Taika Waititi again, lightning hasn't struck twice for the god of thunder. The unexpected moments of comic genius in the previous film have been replaced by forced and predictable gags, and fight scenes that carry no emotional weight or stakes. 

*#*. Marcel the Shell With Shoes On. I'm sure I'll upset some people with this one, but this just didn't do it for me. I found Marcel's voice to be annoying and the plot was pretty thin. 

*#*. Bodies Bodies Bodies. A horror comedy that's light on both horror and comedy, with a final twist that will likely make it virtually unwatchable for a second time. Plus 2022 has a much better choice of murder-mystery-comedy about rich jerks getting killed...

*#*. Men. Having enjoyed Alex Garland's previous two films, I was looking forward to this. And I was actually enjoying it right up until the very end. Have you ever seen a film and thought “I wish the intriguing events of that movie were allegories and not actually happening as shown.”? Yeah, me neither.

*#*. The House. If the second and third segments had lived up to the standards of the solidly scary first segment, this would be way higher up on the list. But as with most anthology films, the framing device seems both unnecessary and counterproductive towards the stories of the vignettes.

*#*. Bob's Burgers: The Movie. Bob's Burgers as a series has gradually started to fade in quality for me, not terrible but far more formulaic and less funny than the earlier seasons were. The movie doesn't break this mould either: watchable but not unmissable.

*#*. Wendell & Wild. It's been an active year for stop-motion animation, and it's good to see Henry Selick back in the director's chair. The animation and character designs are great, but story-wise, this is more akin to Corpse Bride or Frankenweenie in quality than Coraline or The Nightmare Before Christmas.

*#*. Sonic The Hedgehog 2. After the surprisingly competent first movie comes a surprisingly competent sequel. While nothing stunning, it's fun watching the series bringing in more characters from the games (Tails & Knuckles) and Jim Carrey continues to add just the right amount of ham to his performance as Dr Robotnik.

*#*. The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. If you're not a Nicolas Cage fan, this will be lost on you. If you are, this is a great meta-action-comedy with Cage thoroughly mocking himself and his career.

*#*. Spiderman: No Way Home. While not my favourite, or even second- or third-favourite Spiderman movie, the sheer joy in seeing the MCU multiverse expand into other properties and bring in characters you'd never expect to see on screen together cannot be understated.

*#*. The Woman King. This is the sort of film I hoped to see more of after Black Panther was released: fiction told from an African perspective (though admittedly not an African crew and cast). If you can put aside historical inaccuracies (spoiler: most period films have these!), it's an enjoyable enough action-adventure with great acting and appropriately brutal fight scenes.

*#*. The Black Phone. While not particularly scary, this was a fun small-scale horror film with Ethan Hawke making a particularly effective villain, and the child actors all putting in great performances too.

*#*. X. A retro-style non-supernatural horror film in the vein of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or The Last House on the Left. I enjoyed this more than Ti West's previous retro-horror The House of the Devil, and I will get around to watching Pearl at some point.

*#*. Prey. Like the odd-numbered entries before it, this is a satisfying action-horror that shows Predator films work best in the wilderness rather than an urban setting (and when the director actually takes the material seriously), with a well-paced story, some solid fight scenes and a likable protagonist.

*#*. Barbarian. A horror movie made for people who think they can preempt all the story beats of horror movies, only to prove them wrong at every turn. Creepy, gripping and well worth the watch.

*#*. RRR. I've only seen a few Indian movies in my life, but I've come to expect four things from them: a) elaborate song and dance numbers, b) epic run times that stuff as much in as possible, c) gratuitous love triangles and d) over-the-top action sequences, and RRR delivers on all four. A fictional story about two real freedom fighters from Indian history teaming up to take on the British occupiers.

*#*. Thirteen Lives. A compelling reenactment of the rescue of the Thai football team trapped in a flooded cave in 2018. Despite knowing the outcome, it's an enthralling watch, though I would rate The Rescue, a documentary on the same subject, more highly. Also, I correctly guessed beforehand that the British divers, the heroes of the movie, would be played by non-British actors.

*#*. The Batman. While not strictly necessary, this darker take on Batman feels like as much of a commentary on today's society as The Dark Knight was in 2008, with Robert Pattinson's introverted take on Bruce Wayne, and Paul Dano's Machiavellian Riddler giving a previously unseen spin on familiar characters, and despite its 3 hour length, it never drags.

*#*. Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. A more-than-worthy follow-up to Knives Out, matching it in both humour and intricacy. The story is as layered as its title suggests, with unpredictable reveals and a cast that's perfectly able to carry the serio-comic tone.

*#*. Weird: The Al Yankovic Story. Once you get on the film's wavelength and realize it's exaggerated (appropriately) to the point of parody, this spoof of biopics works wonderfully, with Daniel Radcliffe committing to the bit whole-heartedly.

*#*. The Bad Guys. Easily one of DreamWorks' best features. The stylized animation is gorgeous, the character designs are great to look at, and the story is light-hearted enough to be silly, while still being a tad deeper than DW's usual fare.

*#*. Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio. I haven't always liked Del Toro's films but I'm so glad I gave this a try. The stop-motion animation among the best I've seen, and despite the liberties it takes with the source material, it still ticks all the boxes you'd want to see with a Pinocchio adaptation, with some darker fantasy elements thrown in for good measure.

*#*. Turning Red. After a few solid, but not exemplary releases, this is Pixar back in the driver's seat, tackling teenage rebellion and self-discovery in a modern fantasy setting, through the lens of a girl who can turn into a giant red panda. Also, it's the first Disney or Pixar animated film to take place in Canada!

*#*. Everything Everywhere All At Once. As I get older, I worry that I may have already found all of my favourite movies, and that nothing new will truly amaze me like the movies I discovered during my younger years. EEAAO smashes those worries square on in a delightfully chaotic whirl of crazy action scenes, a hilariously insane premise, great performances from all the lead actors, a touching story of parental bonding, regrets and nihilism, and stick-on googly eyes, bagels and butt plugs. This is the most fun I've had at the cinema in years and an easy choice for me for best film of 2022.
