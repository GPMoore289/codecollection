    <h1>Birthday Problem</h1>
	<div class = "synopsis">
	<p><strong>Original Creation:</strong> 21st November 2024</p>
	<p><strong>Uploaded:</strong> 18th Mar 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Status:</strong> Complete. Original code was written without AI.</p>
	<p><strong>Description:</strong> The probability of (at least) two people in a group sharing a birthday in a group rises surprisingly fast as the number of people in that group increases.
	As usual, this is a brute force approach rather than a statistical one (I didn't have Statistics class until the following semester - I now know this is trivial to solve with the permutation function). For the first time, I included
	something akin to a loading progress bar for longer calculations.</p>
