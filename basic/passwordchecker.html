    <h1>Password Checker</h1>
	<div class = "synopsis">
	<p><strong>Original Creation:</strong> 12th September 2024</p>
	<p><strong>Uploaded:</strong> 25th Mar 2025</p>
	<p><strong>Status:</strong> Complete. Original code was written without AI.</p>
	<p><strong>Description:</strong> This program emphasizes the importance of strictly controlling input. The user is asked to enter a password that meets the criteria and will
	"fail" the user unless they do everything correctly. Maybe I should see if my <a href="../utility/passwordcracker.html">password cracker</a> can break this one?</p>
