To get the system report script to run every time a new terminal window is opened:

1. Type "vi ~/.bashrc" into the terminal window.
2. At the end of the document, add the line "bash /path/to/script/scriptname.sh" with the appropriate path name and file name in place.
3. Save and exit the editor.
4. If you get a permissions error opening a new terminal, you may need to give yourself executable permissions by entering "chmod +x /path/to/script/scriptname.sh" into the terminal.

Now, every time a new terminal window is opened, the script will run. To get a new terminal window to open upon login (and therefore also run the script):

1. Create a .desktop file in the user's autostart directory by entering "vi ~/.config/autostart/terminal.desktop" in the terminal window
2. Edit the file to contain the following lines:

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Exec=gnome-terminal
Hidden=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
Name=Terminal

3. Save and exit the editor.

Now, upon logging out and logging back in, the terminal window will open, and combined with the first set of instructions, will also run the script.

I have included a video of the script working, and have also uploaded it to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOB985Q4A4M
